We contribute here a Matlab Graphical User Interface (GUI) for predicting the axial capacity of circular, elliptical, square and rectangular concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns based on a pretrained machine-learning model.

After selecting the value of input variables, the axial capacity of CFST columns is displayed directly by clicking the Start Predict button.
